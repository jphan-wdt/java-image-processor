Low-level image processing tool built using Java featuring over 35 operations including:
- Pixel-level transforms (negative, logarithmic, power law, LUTs, bit planes)
- Arithmetic and bitwise operations between multiple images
- Convolution-based edge detection/enhancement (Sobel, Roberts, Laplacian)
- Convolution-based spatial noise reduction filters (median, min/max, averaging)
- Histogram equalisation
- Manual and automatic thresholding
- Region of Interest filter
